We initially called it \"Shipyard\" but it turns out that name is already taken:\n\n- https://shipyard.build/\n- https://shipyard.run/\n\n\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- Meaningful name\n- Concise\n- Unique\n- Desire to Open Source\n- Easy to type\n\n\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- Option 1: Keep Using Shipyard\n- Option 2: Another Star Trek Name\n- Option 3: Descriptive Name\n\n\n### Option 1: Keep Using Shipyard\n\nWe can keep using the name \"Shipyard\" even though it is already used by other projects.\n\n\n### Option 2: Another Star Trek Name\n\nThere are other options from the Star Trek universe we could use:\n- Utopia Planitia\n\n\n### Option 3: Descriptive Name\n\nWe could use a name that describes what it does.\n\nFor example, it queries Kubernetes resources and then instatiates new resources. So we could call it something\nlike \"kweryput\": it \"queries\" \"K\"ubernetes resources and then it \"puts\" new resources.\n\nWhat options for the second verb are there?\n\n- plonk\n- plunk\n- plop\n- push\n- post\n- splat\n- tpl or tmpl (kwerytpl or kwerytmpl)\n\nOther ideas for names that describe what it does:\n\n- kontemplation\n\n\n### Option 4: Another Interesting Word\n\n- pylon\n- kumon\n- kumquat - could stand for \"KUbernetes Metacontroller QUery And Template\"\n- kroquet\n- kuque (like tuque)\n\n\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nLet's go for *kumquat*. It could potentially stand for \"KUbernetes Metacontroller QUery And Template.\"\n\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n- It's relatively easy to type.\n- No confusion: googling \"kumquat kubernetes\" doesn't have any meaningful hits.\n- We can probably get a cute logo (kumquat with googly cartoon eyes).\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- It's not descriptive; nobody will know what the project does just by hearing its name.\n\n\n"},"creationDate":"2024-09-01T18:09:42.000Z","lastEditDate":"2024-09-01T18:09:42.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"James Dobson","publicationDate":null,"file":{"relativePath":"documents/adr/20240330-name-of-this-project.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/kumquat/kumquat/documents/adr/20240330-name-of-this-project.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/guidewire-oss/kumquat/blob/master/documents/adr/20240330-name-of-this-project.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.0.1"},"__N_SSG":true}
